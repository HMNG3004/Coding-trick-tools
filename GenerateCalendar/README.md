## Generate Calendar Function

Another useful tool in this repository is the Generate Calendar Function, which creates a calendar of the current month in Markdown format. This function is available in both Python and C#.

## Features

- **Markdown Output**: Generates a well-formatted calendar in Markdown that can be used in README files, blogs, or other documentation.

- **Dynamic Month and Year**: Automatically retrieves the current month and year.

- **Readable Format**: Displays the calendar in a table format with days aligned neatly under their respective weekdays.

## How It Works

The function uses the following steps to generate the calendar:

1. Retrieves the current date and determines the first day of the month and the number of days in the month.

2. Constructs a table with headers for the days of the week (e.g., Sun, Mon, Tue).

3. Fills in the days of the month, starting on the correct weekday and leaving blank cells for days outside the month.

This Markdown table can then be embedded in any Markdown-compatible application for clear and concise calendar representation.

## Requirements

For C#: Requires .NET 6.0 or later.

## How to Use

### C#:

1. Run the C# program containing the GenerateMarkdownCalendar method.

2. Copy the console output and paste it into your Markdown file.

## Example Output

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 29  | 30  | 31  |     |     |     |     |
