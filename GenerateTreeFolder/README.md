## Folder Tree Generator

One of the tools in this repository is the **Folder Tree Generator**. This program allows you to generate a folder tree structure from any directory, providing a visual representation of the folder and file hierarchy. It helps you quickly explore and display the structure of a directory with a specified depth.

### Features
- **Generates Folder Tree Structure**: Creates a tree-like structure showing directories and files.
- **Depth Limitation**: Allows you to limit the depth of folder traversal, so you can choose how deep you want the tree to go.
- **User Input**: You can input any directory path, and the program will generate the folder tree for that path.

### How It Works
The program scans the provided directory and recursively lists all folders and files in a tree format up to a specified depth. This is useful for:
- Quickly understanding the structure of large projects or directories.
- Displaying the folder structure of your project in a clean, readable way.

### Requirements
- .NET 6.0 or later (the program is written in C#).
